# How to Get a New ElevenLabs API Key

## Step 1: Visit ElevenLabs
1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/
2. Sign in to your account

## Step 2: Navigate to API Settings
1. Click on your profile icon (top right)
2. Select "Profile" or "Settings"
3. Look for "API Keys" or "Developer" section

## Step 3: Revoke Old Key (Important!)
1. Find your old API key (starts with: e4167b60024f56b71267c20d5690e230...)
2. Click "Revoke" or "Delete" to permanently disable it
3. This prevents anyone from using the exposed key

## Step 4: Generate New Key
1. Click "Create New API Key" or "Generate API Key"
2. Give it a name (e.g., "Virtual Zoo Production")
3. Copy the new key immediately (you won't be able to see it again!)

## Step 5: Save the Key
Keep the new API key somewhere safe - you'll need it for:
- Local development (.env file)
- Production deployment (Render environment variables)

## Alternative: Check if You Have an Existing Valid Key
